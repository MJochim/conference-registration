# conference-registration

This is a webapp that lets visitors register for your conference. It is 
hosted on your premises to make sure that your vistors' data is in your hands
 only.

The webapp was developed by Markus Johim for the association Junge 
Sprachwissenschaft e. V. It is licensed under the terms of the MIT License.
